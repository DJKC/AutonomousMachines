Ene-5B Car V2

The Task was simple: write the software for both an elevator and a self nagivating car.
The code that lies here was not the final solution for either, but it is kept here as an artefact to remember the class.

The hardware kit was that of VEX.
The elevator needed 3 floors along with buttons inside and outside for accessing each floor.
The car used LIDAR (lasers) to nagivate the maze of walls in the literal maze it had to clear.
